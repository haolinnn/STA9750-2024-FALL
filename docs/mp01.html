<h1>Mini-project 1: Fiscal Characteristics of Major US Public Transit Systems</h1>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Public transportation is important for daily essential public service for people. For this project, we aim to investigate the fiscal characteristics of US public transit. It is focused on farebox recovery problem, which refers to the fraction of revenues raised from fares instead of taxes. I am going to use data from the National Transit Database as our primary source.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-metrics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-metrics">Key metrics:</h2>
<p>Farebox revenues, total number of trips, total number of vehicle miles traveled, and total revenues and expenses, Unlinked Passenger Trip (UPT), Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM)</p>
</section>
<section id="data-sources" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-sources">Data sources:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The 2022 Fare Revenue table<br>

<p>In summary, bus has the most total UPT and VRM, which means bus is heavily and widely utilized. Bus provide significant services and plays an important roles to public transporation netwok in the US. NYC subway ridership had significant fall from April 2019 to April 2020. The main reason for this was that it was in the pandemic, and most of people were working and studying remotely, so New Yorkers reduced their travel, and then subway usage fell dramatically. The number of NYC subway services also dropped.<br>

<p>The farebox recovery ratio represents the percentage of operating expenses covered by fare revenues. A higher ratio indicates that the transit system is more self-sustaining through its fare revenue. Compared to other systems, Butler County Regional Transit Authority, with its commuter bus service, recovers a larger portion of its operating expenses and has a greater ability to sustain itself through fare revenue. On the other hand, Central Oklahoma Transportation operates cost-efficiently, with lower expenses per UPT and VRM, offering services at reduced operating costs.</p>

<section id="summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Low expenses per UPT indicate that the agency can transport passengers at a lower cost per trip, resulting in reduced costs per passenger and potentially higher revenues, leading to an improved farebox recovery ratio. Similarly, low expenses per VRM suggest that the transportation service operates at a lower cost per mile, enabling the agency to cover a wider area with reduced operating expenses. The lower the expenses, the more cost-efficient the agency becomes, which in turn increases revenue. Therefore, I believe Central Oklahoma Transportation will be the most efficient agency in the country, with the lowest expenses per UPT and VRM.</p>
